##Cooking Recipe
###baked buffalo wings
![](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/oven-baked-buffalo-wings.jpg?w=1500)

* Ingredients
    * 1 to 4 pounds chicken wings
    * 1 1/2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons baking powder (using 1 1/2 teaspoons per pound)
    * 1 to 4 teaspoons kosher salt (using 1 teaspoon per pound)
    * 2 tablespoons hot sauce (Frank’s RedHot is traditional) per pound of wings
    * 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter per pound of wings
* Special Kitchen Tools
    * Not really
* Steps
    1. Line a large baking sheet with foil and set an oven-safe cooling rack on top. I lightly coat mine with nonstick spray, but it’s probably not necessary.
    2. Pat wings dry with a paper towel, and then, in a large bowl, toss them with 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon kosher salt per pound of wings, until thoroughly coated. Arrange them on the rack with some space between them (the surface will not dry and crisp as well where they touch) and place in your refrigerator uncovered for 8 to 24 hours.
    3. When you’re ready to bake them, heat your oven to 450 degrees, with a rack set in the top half of your oven. Bake your wings for 20 minutes, flip them with tongs or a spatula, bake them for another 15 minutes, flip them back over again, and then for 15 final minutes, for a total roasting time of 50 minutes. You might need up to 5 minutes longer for larger wings. Wings are done with they are browned and crisp.
    4. While the wings roast, make Buffalo wing sauce. In a medium saucepan, for each pound of wings, combine 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons (for a hotter sauce) to 2 tablespoons (for a mild, more buttery sauce) unsalted butter over medium heat until melted, whisking to combine. Set aside. Make Blue Cheese Dressing, if you wish (recipe below) and prepare carrots and celery.
    5. When wings are done, roll each in prepared Buffalo wing sauce. Serve with fixings of your choice. Eat immediately.
* Special Season to Enjoy?
    * Yes! This dish is especially popular during Football season.
* Variations
    * Adjust the hot sauce level and size to change the spice level

##Euclidean Distance
###Definition
__________
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them \(\mathbf{\overline{pq}}\).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean *n-space*, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
d(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) = d(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}) & = \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + \dots + (q_n - p_n)^2} \\
 & = \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i - p_i)^2)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
 
The position of a point in a Euclidean *n-space* is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

\[\mathbf{\parallel{p\parallel}} = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p}},\]

where the last expression involves the dot product.
